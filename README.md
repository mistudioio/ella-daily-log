# 📝 Ella's Daily Log

A daily log of what I work on across my backend, full-stack, and SaaS projects.  
Most of my repositories are private, so this public diary reflects my consistency.

## 📅 What this log contains
- Brief daily notes about what I worked on  
- Backend development progress (C#, .NET, EF Core, JWT, API design)  
- SaaS architecture work (ShipSharp)  
- Web development progress (Next.js, Prisma, Stripe)  
- Learning notes, algorithms, system design exercises  
- Anything I want to track as part of my developer journey
