## 🧩 What I worked on today

- Deployed ShipSharp API to Fly.io and verified that the application builds and runs in a production container environment.
- Restarted and managed Fly Machines via CLI (fly machines restart, fly logs, fly postgres list).
- Confirmed that the API starts successfully and listens on port 8080 in production.

## 🤔 Notes / Problem solving

- Fixed the Fly.io deployment issue by restarting the database machine, resetting Fly secrets, and verifying environment variables.
- Identified that the "cannot connect to database" error had nothing to do with the API code, but with the Fly Postgres VM being suspended.
- Clarified that Swagger only loads when `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = Development`, which is correct for production security.
- Learned how Fly Machines behave: ephemeral, restarting often under trial limits, and don’t retain file system (DataProtection keys warning is harmless).

## 🌱 Learning

- Deployment debugging workflow for .NET on Fly.io: logs → secrets → machine status → DB status → restart → redeploy.
- Understanding Fly.io architecture: how regions, machines, trial limits, and Firecracker VMs work.
- Environment variable management via Fly Secrets UI and CLI — clean, fast, and secure.
